    <h3 class="about-content__title">How does the IATI Validator work?</h3>
    <div class="about-content__description">
      <p class="about-content__description">There are two ways to use the IATI Validator.</p>
      <p class="about-content__description list-item"><span class="list-item-style">-</span> Anyone can upload their
        IATI data files to be checked before publishing them.</p>
      <p class="about-content__description list-item"><span class="list-item-style">-</span> Anyone can check all IATI
        data files that have been published.</p>
      <p class="about-content__description">The IATI Validator undertakes multiple layers of checks to identify where
        data does not comply with the IATI Standard. The Validator provides messages to indicate where errors have
        occurred and what needs to be changed.</p>

  <section class="about-content">
    <h3 class="about-content__title">What happens when the IATI Validator identifies invalid data?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">An error or a warning message is displayed for each occurrence of an error,
      identifying what data needs to be corrected and where it occurs in the data file. A count of errors is also
      displayed which shows how many times an error is repeated throughout a file. For example, if all activities in a
      dataset have omitted activity dates, then the user will see a count of this repeated error as well as the location
      of each error.</p>

  <section class="about-content">
    <h3 class="about-content__title">What help and support can publishers access to correct their data?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">When data requires correcting, an actionable error or warning message will be
      displayed. In the near future, the IATI Validator will be updated to provide specific instructions on how to
      correct data. For additional support using the IATI Validator, please refer to:</p>

    <h3 class="about-content__title">Specifically what checks will be made to IATI datafiles?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">The IATI Validator run checks on datafiles against version 2 of the IATI
      Standard Schema and Rulesets.</p>
    <p class="about-content__description set-title">Check 1: Schema Validation</p>
    <p class="about-content__description">The IATI Validator checks if data adheres to the format set out in the IATI
      XML Schema. The IATI Schema provides the exact order and structure that organisations should provide their XML in.
      Full information about the IATI Schema can be found on <a
        href="http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/schema/">IATI’s Reference site</a>.</p>
    <p class="about-content__description set-title">Check 2: Rulesets Validation</p>
    <p class="about-content__description">The IATI Validator also checks if the data follows IATI’s Rulesets. These
      checks provide a more detailed review of the quality of data. To view the most up-to-date information about IATI’s 
      Rulesets please refer to <a href="https://github.com/data4development/IATI-Rulesets" target="_blank">Data4Developement's 
      IATI Ruleset repository</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="about-content__title">Does the IATI Validator check if datasets have complied with a donor’s requirement
      to publish data to the IATI Standard?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">No. Different donors have their own specific set of data requirements for
      their grantees that are additional to the IATI Standard rules. Organisations need to refer to their donor’s
      guidance and more information can be found on <a
        href="https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/preparing-data/donors-reporting-requirements/">IATI Guidance</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="about-content__title">Can I use the IATI validator to understand what score my organisation will achieve
      in the Aid Transparency Index?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">The <a href="https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/the-index/">Aid Transparency
        Index</a> (ATI) is managed by <a href="https://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/">Publish What You Fund</a>, which
      uses its own methodology to assess the transparency of organisations’ data. Therefore the IATI Validator does not
      check data against the ATI methodology. Organisations who will be assessed in the next Index should refer to
      Publish What You Fund for more information about their upcoming methodology. If needed, IATI publishers are
      welcome to email the IATI Technical Team for support: <a

  <section class="about-content">
    <h3 class="about-content__title">What is the tech stack powering the service?</h3>
    <p class="about-content__description">The IATI Validator is a Java powered application that internally uses Ant for
      the workflow and SaxonHE for data processing, to take full advantage of its built-in XML and XSLT functionalities.
      Schematron Validation Reporting Language (SVRL) is the rule-based validation language of choice for making
      assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees It can be run and deployed as a Docker
      container. More information can be found in the <a href="https://developer.data4development.nl/IATI-data-validator/">IATI Validator User Documentation</a>.</p>
